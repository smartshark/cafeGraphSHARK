# cafeGraphSHARK
A plug-in to identify cause-fix relationships between artifact states based on commits, file actions, and code entity states.

## Requirements

cafeGraphSHARK currently relies on the data provided by humbleSHARK, including the  source paths (which are stored by default), as well as data provided by vcsSHARK and mecoSHARK. Additionally, it depends on commonSHARK (https://github.com/smartshark/commonSHARK) which provides required libraries as well as common funtionalities.
